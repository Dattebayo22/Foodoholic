# Foodoholic

Foodoholic is a food recommending system that can be seamlessly integrated with food delivery applications. The recommendation model utilizes various factors, including last name, age, day, and time of order, to provide personalized food suggestions. The system also analyzes users to categorize them as vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Additionally, a user authentication system has been implemented from scratch to enhance the overall user experience
